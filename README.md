# CPP_readPoints

C++ code for reading raw data on turbulent inlet velocity.  
Prepare shaped data to use in the stagard grid and interpolate in XYZ and time.  
  
Grid scale: length 1 mm x 1 mm, dx = 1e-2 mm  
Time scale: dt = 1e-7 s  

## 2_tinterp branch

This branch is for a time interpolation from spacial interpolated data.
